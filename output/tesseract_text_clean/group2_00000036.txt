Energy Conservatlon Commlttee
September 14,
1975
Th1: 15 the flrst report of the Energy Conservatlon Commlttee,
establlshed by the Board of Dlrectors at 1:: November 1975 meetlng.
Up to that data, and beglnnlng 1n October 1974, an ad hoc commlttee
had dealt energy conservatlon matters.
From October 1974
onward. the Commlttee has malntalnEd, where legally feaslble; a
close liaison and actlve cooperatlon the Department of res and the FEA and 1:: Contractors.
Since 1:: establlshment.
two major responslbllltles:
the Commlttee has been deallng
1. Supervlslng the ongolng Voluntary program of twlce*yearly
reports on energy conservatlon the Department of Commerce and
the F deral Energy Admlnlstratlon.
A5 of the preparatlon of thls
report. the most recent energy conservatlon report was that submltt d 1n Aprll 7 of thls year, 1n whlch 107 MCA member companles
partlclpated.
The report showed energy conservatlon for the
calendar year 1975 as 4.0% per unlt of output, compared 1972
as a base year.
Wlthout the energy costs of OSHA and envlronmental
regulatlons 1n effect 1n 1975 but not 1n 1972, the energy
tlon rate would have been 4.9%.
An overirldlng reason for the
relatlve modesty of these flgures was that, due to the recesslon,
our 1ndustry was operatlng at only 74.2% of capaclty 1n 1975, com?
pared 93.5% 1n 1972.
There are Very few major MCA member companles not taklng part
1n MCA'S energy reportlng program or those of other relevant
atlons. such as the Fertlllzer Instltute and the
Manufacturers Assoclatlon.
These few companles have been 1nd1v1dually
contacted, and will hopefully be taklng part 1n the next report to
the two Federal agencles, due 1n mldiseptember.
Th1: Voluntary program 15 the result ochan October 1974
meetlng between top Commerce Department and FEA offlclals and top
offlclals of some 29 major chemlcal companles, all MCA members.
At
thls meetlng, there was agr ement on a consensus energy conservatlon
goal of 15% per unlt of output by calendar 1980 as compared
037049
calendar
1972.
2. Since December 1975, when the Presldent Signed 1nto law
the Energy Pollcy and Conservatlon Act, the Commlttee has been
seeklng to cope the new 1ndustrlal energy conservatlon pro*
Visions whlch are part of thls Act.
The Act focuses on the ten leadlng energyiconsumlng 1ndustr1es
by twoidlglt 51: codes, offlclally 1dent1£1ed early thls year.
Not
surprlslngly, our 1ndustry 297 ranks flrst.
For each of these top 10 1ndustr1es, FEA 15 to set an energy
conservatlon goal, replaclng the consensus goals under whlch many
1ndustr1e5. 1nclud1ng ours, have been operatlng.
FEA has contracted
Hlth outslde consultants to study each of the ten 1ndustr1es and
propose goals 7 whlch, of course, FEA can accept or modlfy.
Because of the complexlty of the chemlcal 1ndustry, FEA
1n1tlally had dlfflculty gettlng an approprlate contractor to take
on the job.
However. thanks 1n part to MCA'S 1nterest 1n havlng a
quallfled contractor take on thls responslblllty, Battelle Memorlal
Instltute flnally undertook 1:, Hlth Chem Systems as subcontractor
The englneerlng and technlcal subcommlttee of the Energy Conservatlon
Commlttee worked closely the contractors, aiding them 1nd1v1dually
and collectlvely 1n thelr demandlng task, and contrlbutlng thelr ex*
pertlse 1n methodology.
The contractors have submltted thelr .report,
and 1: Will be publlshed 1n the FEDERAL REGISTER 1n late September,
Hlth publlc hearlngs 1n October.
1: 15 qulte posslble that consumer and envlronmental groups may
testlfy 1n opposltlon to any proposed reasonable target for our
1ndustry, so MCA must be prepared to testlfy 1n 1:: own behalf.
Internal studles carrled on by the Commlttee indicate that the in,
dustry can meet a target 1n the nelghborhood of 15%.
In further EPCA requlrements, FEA must 1dentlfy
the top energyiconsumlng companles 1n each of the ten alreadyildeni
tlfled 1ndustr1es 7 Either the 50 hlghestiranklng companles or
those over a trllllon BTU'S 1n energy per year, whlchever
number 15 smaller.
Some an companles reportlng through MCA have
llsted energy purchases of over a trllllon BTU'S a year, and there
may be other such companles reportlng through the Fertlllzer
Instltute, etc.
1: therefore seems llkely that the cutioff polnt
for chemlcal companles Will be somewhat over a trllllon BTU'S per
037049

Under EPCA provlslons and regulatlons, companles reportlng
through 1ndustry programs such as MCA'S may be exempted from
Vldual reportlng, even 15 1: would otherwlse be requlred of them.
The crlterla for acceptable 1ndustry programs will be publlshed 1n
the FEDERAL REGISTER.
However. because FEA 15 falllng behlnd 1:5
EPCA tlmetable, there remalns a 50/50 chance that companles may
have to Elle at least one mandatory 1nd1v1dual report 1n early 1977.
Another sectlon of EPCA provldes for the encouragement and
subsldy of state energy programs.
Here MCA'S prune 1nterest 1: 1n
exemptlng major 1ndustr1es llke ours from reportlng the Varlous
states. Since they already report to Federal agencles.
If, however.
some states insist upon 1ndustrlal energy conservatlon reportlng,
u would urge them to adopt the same system already 1n effect for
Federal reportlng.
After monltorlng two reglonal hearlngs on
state programs, MCA testlfled to thls effect at the plenary
hearlng 1n Washlngton 1n July.
Another area of FEA concern outslde of EPCA 15 1:: program
to promote fuel converslon from 011 and gas to coal.
The future
lssues subcommlttee of the Energy Conservatlon Commlttee has moniltored the questlonnalres to be sent out to companles 1n thls area,
and has made recommendatlons whlch have been persuaslvely relayed
to FEA through a task force of the Industrlal Energy Users Forum.
~ A genulne success was reallzed 1n modlfylng some unreasonable re*
quests 7 e.g. obtruslve flnanclal questlons 1n the Major FuelEurnlng 1nstallatlon questlonnalre.
The Energy Conservatlon Commlttee has four subcommlttees:
englneerlng and technlcal? state relatlons; fuel types; and future
lssues.
1: has also establlshed frultful liaison three other
MCA standlng Commlttees: Government Relatlons, Legal Advlsory, and
Publlc Relatlons.
Government Relatlons contacts have been useful 1n deallng
leglslatlon golng through the Congress concerned 1n one way or
another energy conservatlon.
Publlc Relatlons have helped 1n
the explanatlon of the effect on energy conservatlon of the
relatlvely low capaclty at whlch the 1ndustry was functlonlng 1n
calendar 1975 7 and our presentatlon 1n thls regard was welcomed
by the Department of Commerce and the Federal Energy Admlnlstratlon
as supportlv
of thelr reports to the publlc.
Furthermore, Publlc
Relatlons ass mbled and dlstrlbuted 1nternal and external publlcai
tlons by m mber companles deslgned to promote energy conservatlon.
We shall look to Legal Advlsory liaison for advlce 1n preparlng
testlmony for the Varlous publlc hearlngs whlch Will be scheduled
as part of the EPCA program.
