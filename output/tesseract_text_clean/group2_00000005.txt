DENNIS P. BRIDGE. CHAIRMAN
WASTES MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
APRIL 13, 1975
The prlmary Wastes Management Commlttee concern
1: for leglslatlve proposals for scicalled "Hazardous Waste
Materlals".
For the last several years the reports have
1nd1cated leglslatlve actlvlty durlng the prevlous year and the
expectatlon of restrlctlve leglslatlon the followlng year. Al,
though I am pleased to say that these forebodlngs have not come
to pass, I qulckly note that the current sltuatlon 15 qulte
durlng thls elect'lon year.
The flrst Significant act deallng
Hlth solld waste was passed 1n 1955 and the second leglslatlve
actlon followed 1n 197D.
Durlng 1975 there was leglslatlve
actlvlty 1n thls area and, assumlng Elva years to be a reasonable
gestatlon perlod, 1975 could be the year.
Th1: leglslatlon Will
not be as far reachlng as that proposed for toxlc substances,
but 1: Hill slgnlflcantly 1mpact chemlcal process 1ndustry
operatlons.
Since the last report to the Board, there have been
nine major leglslatlve proposals, elther actual or worklng
"drafts, concernlng solld waste.
of these the Senate Publlc Works
Commlttee 3111 s. 2150 sponsored by Senator Jennlngs Randolph
and the House Interstate and Forelgn Commerce Commlttee, Sub?
commlttee on Transportatlon and Commerce worklng draft as sponsored
by Congressman Rooney, are the two most llkely candldates for
enactment.
The Admlnlstratlon has not sponsored a but has
1nd1cated general support of s. 2150. We expect that each
proposal will reach 1:: respectlve floor 1n May.
Although some undeslrable provlslons. Senator Randolph's

concentrates on state 1mplementatlon of a permlt system Similar

as a means of source waste reductlon and tax 1ncent1ves for recycllng. We belleve that the Rooney worklng draft will be modlfled
to resemble the Senate Publlc Works proposal.
Whatever the flnal form of the leglslatlon, MCA Hill strongly
espouse the concept of requlrements for waste dlsposal
rather than the predetermlnatlon or specification approach currently
belng fostered. Waste should be deemed hazardous only after 1::

Land use leglslatlon could be the most 1n51dlous

Forms of land use regulatlon are currently embodled 1n federal

land use proposals have been made relatlve solld waste d15*
