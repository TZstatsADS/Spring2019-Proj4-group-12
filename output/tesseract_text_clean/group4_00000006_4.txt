EEC 1nventory of exlstlng substances, and a of three years of

Commlttee recosnended that 4,4'7Methylene"
dlanlllne be consldered for testlng for
1:: toxlc effects on human health and the
ronment. The ITC recommended the followlng
studles: carclnogenlclty, mutagenlclty, teratoi
genlclty, other chronlc effects, envlronmental
effects and epldemlology. In a December 31,
1931, filing Hlth the v.5. Dlstrlct Court, EPA
1nd1cated that they expected to make a declslon
on ITC'S testlng recommendatlon on 1n caleni
dar year 1932. In response to the recommendatlon,
manufacturers asked to set up a program
on thls chemlcal. Accordlngly, the Speclal
Programs Dlvlslon convened an exploratory meetlng
where the group wrote a program charter and ten*
tatlve budget. The proposed charter was revlewed
and recelved favorable responses by the Speclal
Programs Advlsory Commlttee and 01A staff.

In 1:: June 1992 filing Hlth the Court, EPA re*
moved from 1:: 1992 schedulE. but stated 1::

Presented by

Vice Chalrman. "Phillips Petroleum Company
Internatlonal trade lssues contlnue to be an area of hlgh actlvlty.
As reported before, the current recesslon has promoted Varlous types of pro*
tectlonlsms all around the world. The GATT Ministerial meetlng be held 1n
November Will be extremely 1mportant for settlng the dlrectlon of 1nternatlonal
trade 1n the 'BD'S. A prune ltem on the u. s. agenda for that meetlng 15
obtaln a recommltment to free trade as well as to complete certaln ltems left
over from the Tokyo Round. In addltlon, 1: 15 planned that the GATT agreements
be expanded 1nto servlces (such as banklng, 1nsurance, englneerlng, and con*
plus an 1nvestment code and expanslon and redeflnltlon of the
generallzatlons system of preferences. Trade relatlons Hlth Europe are not
at thelr healthlest state 1n Vlew of the v.5. sanctlons regardlng the Sovlet
gas pipeline and the counterivalllng duty declslon regardlng steel 1mports
1nto the Unlted States from Europe. on the other hand, the GATT Ministerial
could not come at a more approprlate time from the standpolnt of trylng to
head off condltlons whlch could escalate 1nto trade retallatlon and a re*
enactment of the Smootiﬂawley of the 1930's whlch magnlfled and prolonged
the Great Depresslon. There are just a few ltems I would llke to touch on :97
day whlch are covered generally 1n your brleflng book, some of whlch deserve
some expanslon.
1. The petrochemlcal d15cusslons.. There have been no more
developments 1n regard to further dlscusslons the EEC. Although
there contlnues be some actlvltles, the European
chemlcal 1ndustry appears to be more preoccupled Hlth 1nternal
tlons 1n seeklng means of ratlonallzlng the Significant overicapaclty
that exlsts. There has been conslderable actlvlty regardlng
tlons for talks MexlCo, 1nclud1ng threat governmentitoigovernment,
tn settlng the stage, plus two meetlngs the Department of Commerce
by the panel of advlsors from a number of CMA member companles. The
advlsors that your and other CMA companles have made avaliable are
deed knowledgeable and experlenced and are maklng Significant contrlbui
tlons. The greatest challenge at thls tune 15 deflne objectlves
and reach a consensus on objectlves among the advlsors and the
Department of Commerce. Work 15 proceedlng along these llnes and the
Internatlonal Trade Commlttee of the 15 actlvely pursulng thls.
The flrst meetlng Hlth the government of Mexlco has been scheduled for
sometlme 1n October. However. I made a trlp Mexlco recently and the
task force of the Internatlonal Trade Commlttee has consldered the
matter and we are recommendlng the Department of Commerce that the
CMA 037923
October meetlng be deferred untll sometlme after the flrst of
December when the new government of Mexlco takes offlce, 1: 15 not
felt that meetlngs prior to that tune would be productlve. The
present chaotlc condltlons 1n Mexlco are also a factor 1n
thls recommendatlon.
There have been no meetlngs held Japan although we con*
tlnue to hear that a meetlng Will be requested by them. 1: 15 also
posslble that sometlme 1n the near future He Will get a 51mllar re*
quest from Canada.
2. Competltlve assessment studles are conducted by the
Internatlonal Trade Commlsslon and 1ndependently by the Department of
Commerce regardlng the v. s. petrochemlcal 1ndustry. The purpose of
these studles 15 to attempt to assess the unpact of actlons and pollcles by other governments on the competltlveness of the v. s. chemlcal
1ndustry and are significant to us 1n that they will no doubt form the
basls for the attltude of the v. 5. Government regardlng our
cal 1ndustry 1n trade negotlatlons 1n the future. A number of companles
have been asked for input'lnto these studles and He Will hopefully be
able to see early drafts 1n order that 1naccurac1es and mlsunderstandi
lngs are not promulgated.
3. A Very Significant ltem whlch 15 comlng from Varlous three?
tlons 1nclud1ng the Industry Pollcy Advlsory Commlttee, as well as
through other channels, 15 the dangerous and 1n51dlous Vredellng proposal
consldered 1n the EEC governmental system. most of you may
be famlllar the Vredellng proposal, I 61nd that some are not, so I
would llke to descrlbe 1: brlefly. Th1: proposal would be a dlrectlve
regardlng workers rlghts 1n the communlty whlch extends from EC practlce
of local 1nformatlon exchange and consultatlon to the world stage. 1:
would requlre annual dlsclosure of 1nformatlon by management to employee
representatlves and prior consultatlon Hlth labor representatlves coveri
major corporate worldwlde actlvltles and declslons 1nclud1ng mergers,
shlfts 1n productlon, plant and even 1ntroductlon of new tech?
nology 1nto exlstlng plants. Th1: dlrectlve 15 for companles employlng
at least 50 employees 1n EC countrles. 1: would requlre that each year
the parent 0. 5. company would submlt the management of
1:: EC subsldlarles whlch would 1n turn provlde 1: to the local unlon
labor representatlves coverlng the parent company's worldwlde actlvltles
related to 1:5 economlc and flnanclal Situation, the posslble develop*
ment of the products and sales. 1: would 1nclude productlon
and 1nvestment programs, manufacturlng and worklng methods, 1nclud1ng
new worklng methods, technologlcal 1nnovatlons and health and safety.
The subsldlarles would be requlred to consult the employee repre*
sentatlves at least an days prior to any corporate declslon whlch 15
llkely to have a substantlal affect on the employees' 1nterest a
Vlew to reachlng agreement on the measure planned. The company must post*
pone any declslon untll the unlon opinion 15 recelved or untll the 307day
perlod has elapsed. In addltlon, employees at any other subsldlary than
the one dlrectly affected may also demand to.be consulted. The proposed
CMA 037924
I
dlrectlve also contalns provlslons under whlch the employee representai
tlve 15 authorlzed to open consultatlon the parent company manage*
men: under a provlslon. The employee representatlve Will be
granted appeal rlghts to trlbunal or other natlonal authorltles 1n the
event a management falls to Eulflll the provlslons of the dlrectlve.
Thls, of courSE, has numerous drawbacks whlch 1nclude an extraiterrltorlal
reach glvlng the ability to negotlate Hlth com?
panles on global corporate plans and at the corporate rather than the
1nd1v1dual plant level. 1: could 1nvolve submlsslon of data whlch may be
1n Violation of securltles law and regulatlons, access to corporate
confldentlal or proprletary 1nformatlon and establlshlng a precedent
guaranteelng worker consultatlon on an 1nternatlonal basls.
Th1: dlrectlve 15 now before the European Parllament for a Vote
the week of September 13. The EC Commlsslon are reconslder and proba*
bly redraft the dlrectlve for conslderatlon by the EC Councll of Mlnlsters
1n to late 1933. If adopted, the 1nd1v1dual member states would be
requlred to 1mplement the dlrectlve through natlonal leglslatlon.
Th1: dlrectlve has become polltlcal and represents a major
prlorlty for the European Trade Confederatlon whlch has effectlvely lob?
for 1:. lobbylng on Vredellng 1n the v. s. 15 coordlnated
through the Natlonal Forelgh Trade Councll, the v. s. Councll for Inter*
natlonal the n. 5. Chamber of Commerce, and the NAM. Inltlally,
the lobbylng took the form that thls proposal 1: so bad that 1: should
Simply be dlscarded. Present 15 that Since some form of Vredellng
Will be adopted, lobbylng should take the of attemptlng revlse the
proposal to somethlng that can be llved Ivor Rlchard of Great
Britain 15 the commlsslon member who will be 1n charge of the redraftlng
and 15 the guru of the Vredellng proposal, havlng 1nher1ted thls role from
Vredellng upon the latter's retlrement. Rlchard has 1nd1cated 1n speeches
and other dlscusslons that he 15 flexlble as to the flnal form.
At the present tlme, the CMA posltlon regardlng Vredellng 15
formulated and should be forthcomlng 1n the near future. However, 1n the
meantlme I would urge you to become more famlllar thls proposal and
1:5 potentlally harmful effects.
