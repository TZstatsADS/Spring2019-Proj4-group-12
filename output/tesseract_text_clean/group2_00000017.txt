on Aprll a .5 last year, I restrlcted my comments to two ltems of major 51g,

oral report will focus on three toplcs and I refer you to the ﬁlled report
for the bal.nce.
The 1ndustry owns or operates approxlmately 57,000 tank cars
and 15 by the rallroads through a mlleage allowance of from 11.071
to 23.914 loaded car mlle dependlng on the value of the car. The r51]:
roads pay allowance to suppllers of prlvate r511 cars 1n that freight rates
take 1nto c-nslderatlon a cost to the rallroads of supplylng cars. Prlor to
1954, the per mlle was a onsilevel allowance. A car owner or operai
tor was the same rate per mlle 1rrespect1ve of whether a car had a value
The chemlcal 1ndustry, havlng the newer and hlgher Valued cars, was of
the opinion that the compensatlon paid by the rallroads should recognlze the
dlfference .5 1nvestment 1n the cars and pay a hlgher allowance to the more
Valuable (:55 than paid to cars of lower Value. After long negotlatlons, a
of compensatlon was establlshed 1n November 1954. However,
because of among the rallroads as to how the system was to w rk,
the matter contested before the Interstate Commerce Commlsslon Hlth
the car on one slde and the rallroads on the other.
