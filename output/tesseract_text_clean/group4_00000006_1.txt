REPORT OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
Fernanda., reported the followlng actlons taken by the Executlve
Commlttee the precedlng day:
037993

Approved expanslon of CMA'S state affalrs program, 1nclud1ng the
addltlon to staff of two professlonals and one support person at
an annuallzed cost of $123,000. Th1: 15 to be accompllshed Hlthln
the current budget reduced by $300,000 and Within the presently
authorlzed 147 personnel level.
a
Approved the recommendatlon of the Communlcatlons Commlttee that
the T.V. ad program be postponed 1ndefln1tely. Dr. Fernandez then
put thls declslon 1n perspectlve by revlewlng the hlstory of the
communlcatlons program, 1nclud1ng ChemCAP, and advlslng that reef
ommendatlons Will be recelved from the Communlcatlons Commlttee
1nvolv1ng a Significant reductlon 1n prlnt ad expendltures and a
change 1n emphasls 1n the prlnt ad program.
a
Beard 3 report from Flnance Commlttee Chalrman Sella. The loss of
several members will result 1n 3 dues shortfall of approxlmately
$300,000 thls flscal year whlch would translate to a budget deflclt
of about $400,000 when comblned Hlth the approval of an expanded
state affalrs program. The Executlve Commlttee Hill recelve recomi
mendatlons to control? and reallocate expendltures to 1mplement the
state affalrs program and at the same time avold the deflclt. A
larger budget deflclt 1n flscal 1993794 could occur 15 calendar year
1992 sales. upon whlch next year's dues are based, are lower than
orlglnally estlmated. To antlelpate thls. Board members will be
contacted 1n early October for an estlmate of 1992 sales. Th1: Will
make better plannlng posslble for flscal 1993794. The prellmlnary
budget for flscal 1993794 Will be prepared on the assumptlon that
expenses will be reduced to accommodate about onsihalf of the fore*
casted deficit, the other onsihalf be made up from reserves. 1:
15 hoped there Will be some 1ncreased 1nterest 1ncome whlch would be
helpful. Speclflc recommendatlons Will be recelved at the October
meetlng of the Executlve Commlttee. In Vlew of the indefinite posti
ponement of the T.V. ad program, and the contemplated reductlon of
the prlnt ad program, the ChemCAP speclal assessment 1n December Will
be reduced to approxlmately onsihalf of the orlglnally approved 40
percent level to reflect the actual communlcatlons ex*
penses. 1: 15 planned that thls Will be the last speclal assessment,
Since the June dues for flscal 1993794 would be adjusted upi
ward accordlngly, to reflect the permanent expanslon of the publlc
relatlons effort, 1nclud1ng speclal lssue advertlslng whlch would be
at a substantlally reduced level from prevlous ad expendltures. Th1:
whlch may be looked at as the sum of the dues plus the
speclal assessment, would see a decllne from 140 percent to
mately 125 percent of the prevlous dues base.
a
Beard 3 report from Membershlp Commlttee Caldwell concernlng
membershlp retentlon and recrultment. The commlttee was requested to
contlnue the development of 1:: proposed plan but defer actlon untll
the economlc envlronment was more propltlous.
Fernandez then sollclted help from the Board members con*
tactlng the followlng companles, who have reslgned for flnanclal reasons:

REMARKS TD 13mm:
by James D. Beatty
Energy commlttee
August 30, 1992
Good mornlng. My Energy Commlttee report 15 a llke a good news, bad news
story. The good news has already happened 1n the year just completed; the bad
news 1: waiting to happen 1n 1933. And 1: may 15 we relax our efforts durlng
the current year.
Last year I optlmlstlcally tltled ay report "New Horlzons", antlclpatlng that
we had reached a major turnlng polnt 1n federal energy pollcy. That we could
correct the excesses of the past and 1n partlcular the overregulatlon of the
Carter years and the Elva part Natlonal Energy Act of 1979. That we could
move from supply regulatlon and demand restrlctlon to supply stlmulatlon
through free market prlclng, knowlng that further galns 1n energy conservatlon
and fuel swltchlng and most Importantly market stablllty and predlctablllty
would follow. That optimism was based on the electlon of Ronald Raagan
his free market energy platform. 1: 15 useful to revlew two parts of the
energy plank of the 1980 Bepubllcan platform.
"In order 1ncrease domestlc productlon of energy, RÃ©publlcans
[we] advocate the decontrol of the price at the wellhead of 011 and
gas....We also belleve that market restrlctlons on the use of
natural gas should be ellmlnated.
"Republlcans [we] understand that a free market based on the
collectlve priorities and judgments of 1nd1v1dual consumers will
efflclently allocate the energy supplies to thelr most Valued
users.
The Presldent has dellvered on many of his energy pledges. The Energy
Commlttee llkes to trunk that we have helped over the past year.
last year we identified two major ltems for our energy agenda:
Natural gas deregulatlon, and
Elimination of 1nequ1table federal allocatlon schemes for the
dlstrlbutlon of crude 011 under the Emergency Preparedness Allocatlon Act.
For Emergency Preparedness, we prepared recommendatlons and testlfled before
Congress and lobbled for no to replace the explred EPAA. Whlle these
efforts dldn't convlnce Congress that a was not necessary, we belleve
they dld help to relnforce Presldent Reagan's resolve that no was
needed. Although Congress passed the Standby Petroleum Allocatlon Act, the
Presldent vetoed that and 1n a remarkable turnaround the Senate sustalned
the Veto after passlng the SPAA by a Vote of as 7.
I also reported Significant reductlons 1n the regulatory burden of the Power
Plant and Industrlal Fuel Use Act and thls year I can agaln report even
further galns. These regulatlons were one of those identified for Vice
Presldent Bush's Regulatory Reform Task Force.
037990

In March Presldent Reagan ended any chance of Congresslonal actlon on the
deregulatlon of natural gas when he announced that he would not seek
leglslatlon 1n 1932. consumer actlvlsts and other opponents of
deregulatlon ballad the Presldent's announcement as a major Victory most
observers. recognlzed 1: as a postponement not a solutlon the problems of
the Natural Gas Pollcy Act and the publlc debate has contlnued.
The Energy Commlttee recognlzed that the debate, partlcularly as reported by
the press, was not golng 1n our.d1rectlon. The exaggerated clalms of the
consumer actlvlsts and other opponents of decontrol were conslstently galnlng
headllnes whlle more ratlonal analyses were belng 1gnored. The Energy
Commlttee commlssloned Foster Assoclates, a natlonally recognlzed natural gas
authorlty and consultant, to compare and analyze ten recent studles of natural
gas deregulatlon that Varled wldely 1n thelr findings on the unpact of
decontrol. As you would suspect, the concluslons of each study supported the
Vlews of the authors.
Foster found two studles decldedly more comprehenslve and reallstlc
assessments of total phased decontrol. These were by the Department of Energy
and Standard 011 of Indlana.
Conversely, Foster found three studles predlcted "exaggerated and
unsupportable Eleld price projectlons" and hence contrlbuted llttle a
constructlve analysls of the decontrol issue. In March we held a press
conference to release the Foster study and we followed that a
Congresslonal staff brleflng. Both events were well attended. Just last
month Representatlve Dannemeyer from Callfornla quoted from our study 1n the
current hearlngs before the House Fossll and Synthetlc Fuels
In 1991 our energy conservatlon resumed 1:5 upward progress by clunblng to
24.22, 2.12 better than 1980. Th1: 15 partlcularly encouraglng 1n llght of
the stagnant economy. Our Voluntary goal of :02 appears well Hlthln reach.
1: 15 also of 1nterest to examlne how our raw energy consumptlon has changed
Since 1972. Th1: table reflects raw energy usage as reported by our member
companles. 1: has not been corrected for productlon changes. Significant
reductlons have been made 1n fuel 011 and natural gas consumptlon.
Surprlslngly coal use 15 actually down sllghtly and electrlclty 15 up

I'm afrald

1992/93 GOALS AND
Let's examlne our plans and goals for each of Che major lssues.
First, natural gas deregulatlon.
The chemlcal 1ndustry consumes over two
trllllon cublc feet of natural gas annually whlch 15 more than 10% of the
total Unlted States consumptlon and about 25% of the v.5. 1ndustrlal use.
1993 15 our last chance for leglslatlon to be enacted to replace the NGPA
before 1:: partlal decontrol occurs on January 1, 1935. The Admlnlstratlon
and Congress will be reluctant to address natural gas 1n 1934, a presldentlal
electlon year. Furthermore, our worst case rlsk 15 no longer just "no
actlon"; 1: 15 an extended NGFA. Our baslc posltlon on deregulatlon 15 that
she NGPA be amended to provlde for:
Smooch and predlctable phase up of all natural gas wellhead Ceiling
prices to market clearlng levels.
Free market access for all consumers, pipellnes, and dlstrlbutors to all
types of natural gas supplles.
A coordlnated removal of supply and demand restralnts the
repeal of the 1ndustrlal sectlons of the Fuel Use Act and 1ncremental
prlclng.
In order to make Significant progress over the comlng months 1n the
deregulatlon debate, He must address 1n detall four areas of controversy.
timing of "old" gas decontrol. The 1nterstate pipellnes,
dlstrlbutlon companles, and some predomlnantly 1nterstate consumers are
reluctant to give up natural gas access and blddlng advantages that they have

pipelines are qulte concerned about Imprudent contracts that they have Signed,
