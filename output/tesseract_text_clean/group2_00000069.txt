SECTION 951 REGULATIONS APPROVED
on January 3 the Commlssloner of Internal Revenue approved new
1ncome tax regulatlons relatlng to the allocatlon and apportlonment
of deductlons to gross 1ncome to taxable 1ncome from
sources Within and wlthout the Unlted States the sorcalled
Sectlon 951 Regulatlons.
Inltlally proposed 1n 1973, they were wlthdrawn and reproposed
1n revlsed form last November. MCA submltted wrltten comments
strongly opposlng the 1973 proposal, then testlfled at a publlc
hearlng 1n 1974, recommendlng that the proposed rules be wlthdrawn.
The revlsed proposed regulatlons lssued last November met a number
of our earller objectlons, but 5:111 contalned provlslons whlch we
consldered burdensome. We then submltted wrltten comments on the
revlsed proposal, questlonlng the lssuance of regulatlons 1n the
absence of enabllng leglslatlon and recommendlng addltlonal changes.
A member of our Tax Pollcy Commlttee presented our testlmony at an
hearlng 1n mldinecember.
The flnal regulatlons are substantlally Similar to those lssued
last November. but certaln clarlfylng amendments were adopted.
Baslcally, they will cause an 1ncrease 1n the amount of deductlons,
expenses and losses of v. s. taxpayers requlred be allocated
to forelgn gross 1ncome. The allowable forelgn tax credlt Will
be proportlonately reduced, because taxable 1ncome from sources
abroad determlned under the new rules will almost always be less
than that whlch would be under the old regulatlons.
The effect of the new regulatlons on 1nd1v1dual companles 15
llkely to Vary wldely dependlng on factors such as the scope of
forelgn operatlons, the quantlty of research and development ac*

In late November. the Tax Pollcy Commlttee was polled on the
questlon of whether or not to request a delay for the
