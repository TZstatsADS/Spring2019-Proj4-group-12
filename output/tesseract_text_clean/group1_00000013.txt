1: 15 three years Since the EAC Commlttee last reported dlrectly thls Board.
In the several Significant developments have occurred affectlng the area
whereln the Commlttee functlons 7 namely, the 1ndustrlaliacadem1c 1nterface. These
1nclude: 7 employment opportunltles for new technlcal graduates 1n the chemlcal
1ndustry to low levels; seeond 7 a wave of technlcal staff reductlons by job
ran through the 1ndustry 1n 197D and 1971; and thlrd 7 soclety's attltude
toward our underwent deterloratlon where we now labor under the burden of
a negatlve image. 1: 15 most approprlate, therefore, and I welcome thls opi

to meet our asslgnment and responslblllty the MCA under condltlons so changed from
the past.
COMMITTEE
The was flrst establlshed 1n the 50': when. as you Will recall, there
was a short.ge of graduate chemlsts. The initial objectlve was to encourage students
1 pursue a 1n chemlstry, so as to assure an adequate supply of chemlsts for the
xpandlng of our 1ndustry.
graduate studles lad several of our members to predlct that the high post
World War blrth rates would result 1n an oversupply of chemlsts 1n the early 70's. The
chemlcal beglnnlng 1n 1959, and the layoffs of employed chemlsts and chemlcal
years of an; or less were unemployed. Faced these unsettllng aspects 1n the job
market. the Commlttee declded to modlfy 1:5 objectlves. Instead of stresslng recrultment,
we began to focus on the quallty and type of training sultable for chemlsts golng 1nto
1ndustry.

In looklng -head, we are confronted a confused picture concernlng the
power. longirange studles reachlng 1nto the 1980's by such prestlglous groups
as the Natl-nal Sclence Foundatlbn. Sclentlflc Manpower Commlsslon, Englneerlng

priorities -nd shlftlng actlvltles. And 1n Vlew of thls, 1: would appear that the use of

some degree of uncertalnty 1nto the forecasts. But the welght of the evldence seems to

responslbl- members of the chemlcal 1ndustry, I belleve there 15 cause for us to be
7 over both the short and long range Situation. I Will not burden you a
complete s-atlstlcal analysls that supports thls concluslon, but here are some Significant
detalls.
First, und-rgraduate enrollments for majors 1n chemlstry have hlstorlcally 1ncreased
modestly e.gh year. In 1970, however, the number of 5. degrees awarded 1n
chemlstry for the flrst time 1n 20 years. We conclude that a hlgh "drop out"
rate betwe-n entry and graduatlon for chemlstry majors has taken place.
Second, th- number of flrst year graduate students 1n chemlstry programs has
decllned 2-a Since 1955. Statlstlcs for each year indicate an 1ncreased number of
flelds.
Thlrd, enrollments and earned degrees 1n englneerlng are decllnlng
