Posslbly the most unportant evldence of IAG'S actlvlty 1: 1n the

1n 1:: two? year attempt to avold 1mposltlon of testlng requlrements for

Under an agreement worked out November 15717, spearheaded by EPA

that would allow 1nd1v1dual natlons to select thelr own approaches
for revlewlng new chemlcals. Th1: success 15 due, to a large part, to
