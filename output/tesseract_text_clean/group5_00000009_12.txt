A year ago when John Huasey of Monsanto gave the coaalttee's
December of 1934.
To an Industry already under publlc scrutlny, thls shock added
the eleaents of plant safety and operatlng coapetence to the
publlc's concerns about us.
To deteralne the extent of the
publlc's feellngs about chealcals, Caabrldge Reports recently
conducted a natlonal opinion survey.
The results of that survey were not encouraglng.
Wlthout golng 1nto all the detalls, the publlc's Vlew of the
chealcal Industry was falrly stralghtforward:

More than 70 percent of those questloned feel that a

By
overwhelmlng majorltles, the publlc supports leglslatlon to
create rightitoiknow laws, mandatory emergency plannlng, and
buffer zones around chemlcal plants.
Perhaps one of the more dlsturblng findings was that 54 percent
of those polled aren't so sure that the beneflts they get from
chemlcals are worth the rlsk.
And about an percent of the publlc
wants more regulatlon of the chemlcal Industry even 15 such
regulatlon results 1n hlgher prices for consumer products.
Further. 1: Hill cone as no surprlse to you that we rank last

However. not everythlng the Cambrldge survey found out was
negatlve.
As an example, the publlc Is of mlxed emotlons as to the role
that percelved corporate greed plays In our envlronmental

About 51 percent felt that we're Just out to make a
buck regardless of the envlronmental consequences.
Yet 42
percent dlsagreed that statement.

The best news 15 that three quarters of the publlc feels that the
chemlcal 1ndustry 15 maklng at least soae effort to ensure that a
Bhopalitype accldent doesn't happen 1n the v.5.
that's

We also learned that whlle the publlc 15 concerned about spllls

So as we take steps to

reallze that there Is llttle opportunlty to do somethlng dramatlc
