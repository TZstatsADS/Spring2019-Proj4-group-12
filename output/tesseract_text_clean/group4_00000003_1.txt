DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING
INTERNATIONAL SALES CORPORATIONS
has learned that the Treasury Department 15 conslderlng
a modlflcatlon of the Domestlc Internatlonal Sales Cozporatlon
provlslons of the Internal Revenue Code. Th1: conslderatlon
has arlsen because of allegatlons by European Common Market members
that the arse provlslon Vlolates the GATT Subsldles Code.
Under present law, the arse provlslons permit a corporatlon
to defer current v.5. 1ncome taxatlon on up to onsihalf of 1::
export proflts so long as those proflts are devoted to export
related actlvltles.
In 1979, the latest year for whlch offlclal
Treasury Department flgures are avallable, the chemlcal and
allled products 1ndustr1es deferred 5299.4 mllllon 1n taxes from
ursc sales or 1.5 percent of total gross recelpts. At issue,
however. 15 not only the value of the current tax lhcentlve for
ursc related actlvltles. but the tax treatment of prevlously
deferred ursc 1ncome.
Since the arse provlslons were enacted 1n
1971, total tax deferrals could be substantlal for many CMA
member companles.
At the September meetlng, CMA'S Board of Dlrectors expressed
1:: concern over developments related to and dlrected the Tax
