CONTROL COST ANALYSIS
The Alr Quallty recommends MCA engage an
pendent contractor to 3 study of the cost of control?
The Commlttee
further recommends the study, requlrlng months at a pro*
posed cost of $95,500, be asslgned to Foster u.
Some member company Â®t1mates place the new
tlmated 2 million tons per year of hydrocarbon emlsslons
new levels. Annual operatlng and malntenance costs would be 1n
Draft EPA guldellne documents
indicate estlmates of control costs at much lower levels.
The
crltlcal nature of the contemplated reductlons can be
ated from reallzlng that 15 lbs/day may be the maxlmum allowed,
whereas :00 lbs/day now are 1n most clrcumstances.
The study has been deslgned to ascertaln how much 1: Will
Cost, reasonably avaliable control technology to
reach four levels of hourly emlsslon rates and four levels of
dally rate limits.
The study will yleld data necessary :9 e57
tabllsh the relevant costibeneflt correlatlons needed to deflne
the cruclal polnt of dlmlnlshlng return and the cost effectlv ness of at least four baslc RACT methods.
Data will be provlded by MCA member company plants.
Analysls
Will be made by the contractor,
1: 1: expected that about sun
1nd1v1dual member company plant responses will be obtalned. Data
will be encoded for confldentlallty and facllltate retrleval
for analysls.
Drlglnal data sheets will not be copled and Will
be returned to the orlglnator after the study 15 complete.
Infori
matlon Will be gathered on emlsslon characterlstlcs (flow Volume,
composltlon, concentratlon, solublllty, etc.7, by sources (stacks,
Vents. rellefs. etc.7 accordlng to plant locatlon.
Current levels
of control, the methods employed, and the costs will be stated.
Estlmates of the cost of control will be compared agalnst known
situations to Valldate overall estlmatlng procedures.

Major prof

EPA has
also announced a goal of 90a reductlon 1n hydrocarbon Vapor

Currently, there 15 no 1ndustry data for development of
