DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING
INTERNATIONAL SALES CORPORATIONS
has learned that the Treasury Department is considering
a modification of the Domestic International Sales Corporation
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. This consideration
has arisen because of allegations by European Common Market members
that the DISC provision violates the GATT Subsidies Code.
Under present law, the DISC provisions permit a corporation
to defer current U.S. income taxation on up to one-half of its
export profits so long as those profits are devoted to export
related activities.
In 1979, the latest year for which official
Treasury Department figures are available, the chemical and
allied products industries deferred $288.4 million in taxes from
DISC sales or 1.5 percent of total gross receipts. At issue,
however, is not only the value of the current tax incentive for
DISC related activities, but the tax treatment of previously
deferred DISC income.
Since the DISC provisions were enacted in
1971, total tax deferrals could be substantial for many CMA
member companies.
At the September meeting, CMA's Board of Directors expressed
its concern over developments related to and directed the Tax
