Exhibit G
REPORT TO THE BOARD
MANUFACTURING CHEMISTS ASSOCIATION
GEORGE A. COFFENBERG, CHAIRMAN
MAY 11, 1976
on April 8 of last year, I restricted my comments to two items of major sig­
nificance having future impact on the chemical industry. A more detailed
oral report will focus on three topics and I refer you to the filed report
for the balance.
The industry owns or operates approximately 67,000 tank cars
and is by the railroads through a mileage allowance of from 11.071
to 23.814 loaded car mile depending on the value of the car. The rail­
roads pay allowance to suppliers of private rail cars in that freight rates
take into consideration a cost to the railroads of supplying cars. Prior to
1964, the per mile was a one-level allowance. A car owner or opera­
tor was the same rate per mile irrespective of whether a car had a value
The chemical industry, having the newer and higher valued cars, was of
the opinion that the compensation paid by the railroads should recognize the
difference of investment in the cars and pay a higher allowance to the more
valuable cars than paid to cars of lower value. After long negotiations, a
of compensation was established in November 1964. However,
because of among the railroads as to how the system was to w rk,
the matter contested before the Interstate Commerce Commission with
the car on one side and the railroads on the other.
in 1964 through May of this year, three major car compensa­
tion cases been adjudicated before the In 1971, after a fav rable
an MCA complaint, the three-level system of compensation es­
tablished 1964 was changed to a system. However, the rates of

Division 2 for MCA's complaint was supported by. the American Petroleum *
Institute, the Corn Refiners Association, the Institute of Shortening and
Edible the major tank car leasing companies and Allied Chemical Corp ra­
tion.
The agreement accomplishes the following:
to be Increased on thirty days' notice by 22-1/2%. This
Increase became effective May 1, 1976. Tank car compen­
sation had not been increased since January 1, 1971. It
is estlmatad that the increase annualized will return to
the tank car perators an additional $40 million. The

quarter of 1977 when the railroads increase car compensa­
tion to other.
New tank cars entering the rail fleet, frozen at 1968
valuations for the purpose of compensation, will now
enter the at their fair market value. For example,
a car in 1976 dollars at $27,000 will call for a
mileage of 23.814 per loaded mile whereas prior to

of 21.894. Existing cars will be re-evaluated and if the

age group, the car will be reassigned to the higher group.

last dealt at length Public Law 92-500, the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act, and in particular, the 1972 amendments covering spills
of hazardous polluting substances and the civil penalties provided for such
spills in section 311. I advised that an ad hoc inter-Industry committee,
sections the law and section 12 of the bill, while not totally the lik­
of ad hoc committee, would have been a vast improvement from the
existing MCA testified in support of the caveats as to the

mony. EPA Administrator, Russell Train, testified in support of H.R. 9560,
including support of section 12. The desired revisions in the law, as en­
compassed in section 12, were recommended by the House Public Works Subcom­
However, mark-up before the full House Committee on Public Works
and Transportation, the penalty language in section 12 underwent a significant

In to placate certain Committee members who were seeking to preserve
the penalty of $5,000,000 when from a vessel and $500,000 when from a
facility, as provided in the 1972 amendments, the Committee ap­
proved a approach to penalties. The amendment, in effect provides
a maximum penalty of $50,000 for a first spill, a maximum of $100,000 for a
period. The mark-up made no change in the language concerning

those who are familiar with legislative procedures that the mark-up committee
has made a "Christmas Tree" of the bill, chat it stands a very good
chance of being voted down by the House. If this does not occur, because

Since 1968, the Department of Transportation has been attempting to
develop a new hazard information system integrating vehicle placards and
shipping papers the ability for a quick emergency response. The DOT's
most recent effort is an advance notice of rule making identified Hazardous
Docket No. 126. The XT requested that responses to the docket
evaluate nine hazard information systems proposed by respondents in a past
docket nine criteria that a hazard system should meet.
MCA's was a modification of its prior proposal and it is believed
more meets the nine criteria than any of the other systems. It
integrates the vehicle placards, the shipping papers, an lnmediate ability

able for international shipments. We believe the MCA response is the lead­
