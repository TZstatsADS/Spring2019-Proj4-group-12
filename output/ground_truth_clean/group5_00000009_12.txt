Cobhunications Committee Report
to CMA Board
January 28, 1986
A year ago when John Huasey of Monsanto gave the coaalttee's
December of 1984.
To an Industry already under public scrutiny, this shock added
the eleaents of plant safety and operating coapetence to the
public's concerns about us.
To deteraine the extent of the
public's feelings about cheaicals, Caabridge Reports recently
conducted a national opinion survey.
The results of that survey were not encouraging.
Without going into all the details, the public's view of the
cheaical Industry was fairly straightforward:
We are perceived
as the nuaber one environaental risk to society and the nuaber

two safety risk, the nuclear power Industry ranked as number
one.
More than 70 percent of those questioned feel that a
Bhopal-type accident Is likely to happen In the U.S.
By
overwhelming majorities, the public supports legislation to
create rlght-to-know laws, mandatory emergency planning, and
buffer zones around chemical plants.
Perhaps one of the more disturbing findings was that 64 percent
of those polled aren't so sure that the benefits they get from
chemicals are worth the risk.
And about 60 percent of the public
wants more regulation of the chemical Industry even if such
regulation results in higher prices for consumer products.
Further, It will cone as no surprise to you that we rank last
even the nuclear power and alcohol Industries.
However, not everything the Cambridge survey found out was
negative.
As an example, the public Is of mixed emotions as to the role
that perceived corporate greed plays In our environmental

About 51 percent felt that we're Just out to make a
buck regardless of the environmental consequences.
Yet 42
percent disagreed that statement.

The beet news is that three quarters of the public feels that the
chemical industry is making at least soae effort to ensure that a
Bhopal-type accident doesn't happen in the U.S.
that's
hardly great news, it does show that the public is at least
somewhat aware of our excellent safety record and the things
we're doing to improve it even further.
We also learned that while the public is concerned about spills
and leaks and accidents, they feel that It is the
health effects that are most
So as we take steps to
ensure against accidents and crises, we should not lose track of
about chronic health effects from exposure and use of chemicals.
In implementing a strategy to rebuild our reputation, we should
realize that there Is little opportunity to do something dramatic
to showcase our efforts.
As H. Clark said in Washington
recently, "We haven't been caught doing

Our goal should be to answer the public's fears about us
so that their reasonable concern translate into extreme

In responding to Bhopal, the industry wifely steered clear of
progress that would be seen aerely as public relations gestures.
By creating the CAER and prograas, has given the
Industry an activist response that involves an operating
coaaitaent by line aanageaent.
These prograas are comprehensive
and directed four-square at the public's aajor concerns about the
Industry.
Mot coincidentally, they also provide an excellent
communications opportunity at the local and state level that we
aust use to our advantage.
The current state of the industry's aedla relations and
cosaunications efforts is one of those good news/bad news
situations.
The good news is that the Intense aedia attention to

We now have access
The bad news, of course, is
that It took some tragic events to bring this about.
When I say Intense media attention, I mean that literally.
The
number of media calls fielded by in 1985 reached 10,000.
That's an 11 percent percent Jump from 1984.
At Amoco we
received 26 percent more media calls about our chemicals
in 1984-85 than in 1982-83.
I'm sure that each of your companies
would report similar results.
Despite this media attention and despite the negative news items
of 1985, a professional view is that our treatment by the media
could have been a lot worse.
each member of the
communications committee can recall a few horror stories from
1985, we agree that, on balance, the Industry received fair
treatment.
This occurred as a natural result of increased
personal contact between the media and the members of our
industry.
In many instances, our open and candid response during
these negative incidents helped establish credibility with the
media and showed our concern and our reasonableness.
As a result, we have created relationships some media people
