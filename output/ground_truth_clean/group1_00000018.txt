Proposed
Research Program
on
Carcinogenic Potential of Chloride
EXHIBIT A
Purpose
The purpose of this program is to provide scientific
to clarify the status of vinyl chloride (monomer)
in reference to carcinogenicity.
Proj ect
As recommended by an Ad Hoc Planning Group for
Chloride Research, composed of representatives of eight MCA
member companies, the project is to contract for animal test­
research under which experimental animals would inhale
vinyl chloride monomer vapor at selected concentration levels
and be examined in accord with an agreed-upon testing and
examination protocol.
Planned duration of the project is
three years.
According to quotations from Industrial
Laboratories, Inc., with which the contract is in prospect,
and an allowance for vinyl chloride supply and contingencies,
the projected cost is $193,000.
Funding
Funding commitments have been received from seventeen
MCA member companies sufficient in the aggregate to cover the
stated cost. Company shares are pro-rated on the basis of
publicly announced tonnage production capacity for vinyl
chloride monomer plus polyvinyl chloride.
